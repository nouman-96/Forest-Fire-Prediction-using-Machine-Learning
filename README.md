# Forest-Fire-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

Forest fire data set is used to train the AI models for predicting forest fire. The data set is imported in colab
(an open source Google Cloud Server) and data set visualization tools provided by anaconda (an open source
platform for AI) are used for analysis. A preprocessing technique is used to encode the data set for training
provided by Scikit learn. By using cross validation on data set the data set is splited into training and testing
data set. Three AI techniques were used which are Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Deep Neural Network
(DNN) and Decision Tree Regressor (DTR). At the end the performance measures of all the techniques are
compared.
